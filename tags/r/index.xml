      <description>During the course of your information security management and reporting you may find yourself in need of a tool for soliciting feedback to assess program operational capabilities. It may be useful to employ a Capability Maturity Model to gauge the emotional current state of a given practice.

      <description>Our family is in the habit of heading west. As such, we&amp;rsquo;ve passed through Amarillo, TX a time or two. I&amp;rsquo;ve even stopped into the Big Texan once for breakfast.
For miles down I-40 you&amp;rsquo;ll see billboards for this restaurant and brewery advertising a free 72oz steak, if you can eat it.
An office debate erupted amongst two of my colleagues over just what types of people end up beating the beast.</description>
