This article contains some of my advice on how to go deep and what can be done to start getting up to speed on Information Risk in your first 3 hours.
Mark the books you should read [10 minutes to order some books or add them to a queue]:  Measuring and Managing Information Risk: A FAIR Approach How to Measure Anything in Cybersecurity Risk Against the Gods: The Remarkable Story of Risk Then just go ahead and dig into The Society of Information Risk Analysts Recommended Reading  I recommend picking these two up at the same time and reading them in the order listed.</description>
