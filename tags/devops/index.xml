      <description>Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s more of a crazy straw than a pipeline. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly more fun than useful at the moment.
I know, it&amp;rsquo;s 2020 and there are other CI/CD tools out there. Slicker tools. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know any of them. So, why Jenkins? Jenkins has been around, it supports a lot of build types and stages, and my unscientific research of querying the job listings on Indeed.com and LinkedIn.com show it to still be pretty well owning the market.</description>
