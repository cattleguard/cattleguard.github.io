So, I tried quite a few things that didn&amp;rsquo;t work when integrating ZAP into Jenkins. Many of these were due to a general lack of knowledge with Jenkins. Some were due to holding on to personal objectives such as knowing that I was using the ZAP owasp/zap2docker-weekly:latest docker image.
I liked having each npm stage broken out for debugging purposes (though this seems to be not much of an issue right now since each step is broken out in Blue Ocean), but wasn&amp;rsquo;t sure what to do to keep it all in one container and then pop-out to a new ZAP container in parallel at the end.</description>

      <title>Jenkins, My First Pipeline</title>

Maybe it&amp;rsquo;s more of a crazy straw than a pipeline. It&amp;rsquo;s certainly more fun than useful at the moment.
I know, it&amp;rsquo;s 2020 and there are other CI/CD tools out there. Slicker tools. I don&amp;rsquo;t really know any of them. So, why Jenkins? Jenkins has been around, it supports a lot of build types and stages, and my unscientific research of querying the job listings on Indeed.</description>
