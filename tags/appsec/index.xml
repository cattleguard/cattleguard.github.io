      <description>&lt;p&gt;After tuning in to Absolute Appsec ep 2 the other day I got pretty interested in CORS security issues related to misconfiguration and dynamic origin handling.  I don&amp;rsquo;t know about you, but every once in a while I hear about a bug class, or maybe just a set of unintended consequences that I find particularly amusing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;rsquo;ve found that building a tool (no matter how poor), goes a long way toward a deeper understanding.  For a tool that issues a potentially large number of requests, matching and could perform functions concurrently Go seemed like an appropriate language.  Also, I&amp;rsquo;ve been looking for a reason to give it a try =).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So, I decided to take golang for a spin.  You can find the result here:   &lt;a href=&#34;https://github.com/cattleguard/cors-gopher&#34;&gt;https://github.com/cattleguard/cors-gopher&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
